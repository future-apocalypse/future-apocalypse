Hello 🙋🏻‍♂️, hope you're doing well. My name is Mihail Verejan, I'm from Moldova 🇲🇩
Y2K boy. <br /> I'm (trying to be) an indie game developer (self-taught), currently making some games that I saw in my dreams at night,
also all my projects are made from the ground up (textures, models, code, etc.). I have an obsession to make 
all stuff by myself. <br />  I started this journey because, then I was a kid my parents gifted me a PS2 and 
I have fallen in love with this thing. I'm in love with retro graphics, low poly with Texture Atlas... all this stuff, after some years,
this started in me a desire to find some information on how was games made, how to build your own, how to create your own world,
to be like a god who is creating another perfect place, and here my journey was started. <br />
In the time you are reading all this I probably right now coding or thinking on another awesome game 🫶🏼. <br />

P.S. I'm open everytime to learn or to do something cool 🧠.<br />
